In what way have been a leader?
I’ve had several jobs where I’ve played a leadership role, responsible for seeing that job gets done, and I have always had successful outcomes. More important though, I feel in the past few years that I’ve developed an ability to spot potential in others and have been able to foster their development. For me, that is the real challenge of leadership: helping others to meet their potential. 
When I am working in a particular project, I like to look at the strengths each one brings to the project and then delineate roles based on their expertise. It works out well. 
A successful manager needs to be able to analyze situations quickly, determine appropriate response, and take action. Most important, though, I think, is a persons ability to read people. Each employee is unique. Knowing that and adapting your approach to one that will work is what successful management is all about.
Under what condition have been most successful in your undertakings?
My approach to problem solving involves systematic process of gathering relevant information about a problem, clearly identifying the problem, setting a strategy, and then implementing it. I have noticed that many people skip the first two parts and jump straight to strategy. As long as I have enough information and a clear view of the problem, I can tackle anything. 
How hard do you work? 
For me the question is not how hard I work. It is given that if I have set an objective or if I have been given an assignment, I work as hard as necessary to achieve the desired results. The question for me how smart I work- that is, what can complete the task early and smoothly as possible so that I can move on to other things. 
What are the most important things you look in a job? 
I am looking for a job that utilizes my skills. It is important that my role in the organization be clearly tied to the goal of the organization. It would be great to have a job that is at times challenging and stretches me beyond my current abilities. 
How would you go about creating a plan for your unit? 
I believe that planning is one of the most critical skills a manager can have. The key is using a systematic process. First, you need to gather information from all staff members. Next you need to review and analyze the input. Once you understand what you are working with, you create a plan with goals and objectives. Next you implement the plan. Finally, you evaluate, on an ongoing basis, how things are going and adjust as required. 
How important are details for you? 
I think that attention to details can make the difference between acceptable results and excellent results. Building in quality controls from the start of the project is a way to ensure that the project has the best possible outcome. I believe the more careful you are in the early stage of a project, the less likely you are to have problems in the later stages. 
What kinds of situation bothers you? 
I think the thing that bothers me most, and it doesn’t happen often, is when a problem lingers too long. I don’t think there is room for unresolved problems. I like to find good solutions as quickly as possible so we can get on with the business of the organization. 
What do you do when you know you are right, and others disagree with you? 
First, I make sure I have enough accurate information to maintain my position. Once I am really convinced my prospective is the one to go with, I pay close attention to the particulars of the oppositions objections. I try to reason with then by looking at the situation from their perspective. Given mutual commitment, I find agreement can eventually be reached. 
Do you feel qualified? 
Although I’m sure that there are things to learn in every new job, I think you will find that I’m a quick study. I have got the skills to meet the needs and I don’t see any real obstacles in my way. 
How well do you work under pressure? 
Anyone who is doing work that is worthwhile will experience pressure on the job at times. I can handle a reasonable amount of pressure, and even extreme pressure when the circumstances demand it. The key to handling pressure for me is finding ways to manage situations to alleviate the intensity of the pressure – that way, it does not interfere with my productivity. I know pressure comes with any job and I work well under pressure when it is necessary. 
How do you build relationship? 
As a team/project lead, I always maintain a good relationship with my peers and team members. Having a good, effective relationship is critical to success for any manager. You have to help the team members succeed for you to be successful in your role. I am open and respectful. I always provide feedback in private when they need improvements. I appreciate that everyone has a life outside work. So I try to be reasonable in my demand and strive towards providing a healthy work-life balance to everyone. I don’t penalize anyone for making mistakes. Typically one has good intentions in doing and executing the assigned task. As a lead I always take the full ownership and accountability when mishap happens. I discuss with the team members on what is working, what is not and what should be done differently. I always share credit for accomplishments, ideas and contributions and promote teamwork. A supervisor is as good as the team members and the results are actually the results of the teamwork. Hence the team members deserve as much credit as the team lead when the 
Another think I would do is helping the team members – 
-	Help the team members establish the performance goals – get them to draft out their own performance goals and provide feedback. As a team lead I will be reasonable with the team members and mutually agree on the right goals. 
-	Allocate 30minutes once a fortnight to ensure that tasks are on track. Use the time to discuss the progress – what is working and what is not and what should be done differently. 
-	I always believe in two-way communication for continuous improvement. I am open to feedback and would act on it. This will build the trust of mutual respect and give them the confidence that I am serious on continuous improvements.
